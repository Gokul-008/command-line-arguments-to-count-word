# command-line-arguments-to-count-word
## AIM:
To write a python program for getting the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
## EQUIPEMENT'S REQUIRED: 
PC
Anaconda - Python 3.7
## ALGORITHM: 
### Step 1:
Import the sys module.
### Step 2: 
 Pass the filename as the first argument after the name of script.Open the file as sys.argv[1]
### Step 3: 
Read the file using read() method.
### Step 4:  
Use split() method to split the file content into words.
### Step 5: 
Use len() to find the total words.
### Step 6: 
Run the program to determine the number of words in the file created.
## PROGRAM:
```
import sys
d={}
f=open(sys.argv[1],"r")
for line in f:
    l=line.split(" ")
    for word in l:
        if word not in d:
            d[word]=1
        else:
            d[word]+=1
print(d)
f.close()
```
### OUTPUT:

## RESULT:
Thus the program is written to find the word count from the contents of a file using command line arguments.
